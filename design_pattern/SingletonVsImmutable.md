The **immutable class** and **singleton class** are two distinct design patterns in Java, and they serve different purposes. Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

### **1. Purpose**

- **Immutable Class**:
    - The primary purpose of an immutable class is to create objects whose state cannot be changed after they are created.
    - It provides a way to create read-only objects that are inherently thread-safe because their fields cannot be modified.

- **Singleton Class**:
    - The primary purpose of a singleton class is to ensure that only one instance of a class is created throughout the application's lifecycle.
    - It controls object creation and provides a global access point to that single instance.

### **2. Characteristics**

- **Immutable Class**:
    - **Multiple Instances**: You can create multiple instances of an immutable class, but once created, the state of each instance cannot change.
    - **Thread Safety**: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe because their state does not change after they are constructed.

- **Singleton Class**:
    - **Single Instance**: Only one instance of the class is ever created. Every time you access the singleton, you get the same instance.
    - **Thread Safety**: Singleton classes can be thread-safe, but they need to be implemented carefully (e.g., using synchronized methods or initialization techniques).

### **3. Example**

- **Immutable Class Example**:
  ```java
  public final class ImmutableStudent {
      private final String name;
      private final int age;

      public ImmutableStudent(String name, int age) {
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
      }

      public String getName() {
          return name;
      }

      public int getAge() {
          return age;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Singleton Class Example**:
  ```java
  public class SingletonDatabase {
      private static SingletonDatabase instance;

      private SingletonDatabase() {
          // private constructor to prevent instantiation
      }

      public static SingletonDatabase getInstance() {
          if (instance == null) {
              instance = new SingletonDatabase();
          }
          return instance;
      }
  }
  ```

### **4. Usage Scenarios**

- **Immutable Class**:
    - Used when you need multiple instances of objects, but you want to ensure that their state cannot change once created.
    - Common in functional programming, value objects (e.g., `String`, `LocalDate`), and concurrent programming to prevent race conditions.

- **Singleton Class**:
    - Used when you need only one instance of a class to coordinate global operations (e.g., database connections, configuration management, logging).
    - Typically used for managing shared resources and providing a global access point.

### **5. Key Differences**

| Feature              | Immutable Class                                    | Singleton Class                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Instance Count**    | Can have multiple instances                        | Only one instance in the JVM                     |
| **State**             | Immutable (state cannot be modified)               | Mutable (singleton objectâ€™s state can be modified)|
| **Thread Safety**     | Inherently thread-safe due to immutability         | Thread-safety must be ensured via design patterns |
| **Usage**             | Used to represent constant or read-only data       | Used to manage shared resources or configuration  |
| **Creation**          | Instances are created normally via constructors    | Instance is controlled via a `getInstance()` method|

### **6. Relationship**

While both patterns can be used together, they solve different problems. For example, you could have a singleton class that holds an immutable object or a singleton that manages immutable configuration data. However, they are conceptually different:
- Singleton is about **object creation** control (only one instance).
- Immutable is about **state management** (once created, the state doesn't change).

### **Summary**

- **Immutable Class**: Ensures that the object's state cannot be modified after it is created. Used when you want objects to remain constant.
- **Singleton Class**: Ensures that only one instance of the class exists. Used when a single, globally shared instance is needed.
