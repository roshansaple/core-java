Letâ€™s go through each concept step by step with simple definitions, examples, and best practices to help you prepare for your multithreading interview in Java.

### **1. What is a Thread?**
- A **thread** is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. It is a separate path of execution within a program that allows multiple tasks to run concurrently.

### **2. What is a Process?**
- A **process** is an instance of a program in execution. Each process runs independently and has its own memory space. A process can contain multiple threads.

### **3. Difference Between Thread and Process**:
- **Process**:
    - Independent memory space.
    - More expensive to create and manage.
    - Runs separately from other processes.

- **Thread**:
    - Shares memory within the process.
    - Cheaper and faster to create.
    - Multiple threads can run concurrently in the same process.

### **4. Creating Threads in Java**

#### **A. Using `Thread` Class**

You can create a thread by extending the `Thread` class.

**Example**:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread 1 - Count: " + i);
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();  // Starts the thread
    }
}
```

#### **B. Using `Runnable` Interface**

You can also create threads by implementing the `Runnable` interface.

**Example**:
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Runnable 1 - Count: " + i);
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t1.start();  // Starts the thread
    }
}
```

### **5. Thread Lifecycle**

A thread in Java goes through the following lifecycle states:

1. **New**: The thread is created but not yet started.
2. **Runnable**: The thread is ready to run after calling `start()`, but it may not be running yet.
3. **Running**: The thread is actively executing its task.
4. **Blocked/Waiting**: The thread is inactive, waiting for resources or for a condition to be met.
5. **Terminated**: The thread has finished execution.

#### **Thread Lifecycle Diagram**:
```
        +-----------+  
        |   New     |  
        +-----+-----+  
              |  
          start()  
              v  
        +-----------+  
        | Runnable  |  
        +-----+-----+  
              |  
           Running  
              v  
+---------+  +---+  +------------+  
| Blocked |<-+    ->| Terminated |  
+---------+         +------------+
```

### **6. Thread Safety**

- **Thread safety** ensures that shared resources (variables, collections, etc.) are accessed correctly by multiple threads to avoid data inconsistency or corruption.

#### **Ways to Achieve Thread Safety**:
1. **Synchronized Methods/Blocks**: Ensures only one thread can access the block/method at a time.
2. **Locks (`ReentrantLock`)**: Provides more control over synchronization.
3. **Atomic Variables (`AtomicInteger`)**: Provides thread-safe operations on variables without locking.

**Example of Synchronized Block**:
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

### **7. When to Make a Class, Method, or Block Thread-Safe**
- **Class**: If the class contains shared data accessed by multiple threads.
- **Method**: If the method modifies shared data and can be called by multiple threads.
- **Block**: If only a small section of code modifies shared data, synchronize only that block for better performance.

---

### **8. Thread Communication**

Threads communicate by using methods like `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`.

**Example**:
```java
class SharedResource {
    public synchronized void produce() throws InterruptedException {
        wait();  // Wait for notification
        System.out.println("Resumed production!");
    }

    public synchronized void consume() {
        notify();  // Notify waiting threads
        System.out.println("Consuming...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

        new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                resource.produce();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }).start();

        new Thread(() -> {
            resource.consume();
        }).start();
    }
}
```

### **9. Java Programs That Use Threads Internally**
- **Garbage Collection**: Runs in a separate thread.
- **Swing UI**: Uses the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT).
- **Scheduled Executors**: Use threads to schedule tasks.

---

### **10. Daemon Threads**

- **Daemon Threads**: These are background threads that run behind the scenes and are terminated by the JVM when all user threads (non-daemon threads) finish execution.

**Example**:
```java
class MyDaemonThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            System.out.println("Daemon thread running...");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyDaemonThread daemonThread = new MyDaemonThread();
        daemonThread.setDaemon(true);  // Set thread as daemon
        daemonThread.start();

        System.out.println("Main thread finished.");
    }
}
```

---

### **11. Giving a Name to a Thread**
You can name threads to help with debugging and management.

**Example**:
```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Thread running"));
t.setName("MyThread");
t.start();
System.out.println("Thread name: " + t.getName());
```

---

### **12. Thread Priority**

Threads have priority levels ranging from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). The JVM uses these priority levels to decide the order of thread execution.

**Example**:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();

        t1.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);  // Set priority to 1
        t2.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);  // Set priority to 10

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```
