### Abstraction in Java

**Definition**: Abstraction is an object-oriented programming principle that focuses on exposing only the essential features of an object while hiding the implementation details. It helps in reducing complexity by allowing the programmer to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.

### Need for Abstraction in Java

1. **Simplifies Complex Systems**: By hiding the implementation details, abstraction helps in managing complex systems more easily.
2. **Improves Code Readability**: It makes the code easier to understand and maintain by exposing only the necessary parts.
3. **Enhances Reusability**: Abstracted components can be reused across different parts of the application.
4. **Facilitates Changes**: Changes in implementation details do not affect the code that relies on the abstraction, promoting flexibility.

### Advantages of Abstraction

1. **Reduces Complexity**: By hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts.
2. **Improves Maintainability**: Easier to manage and modify the code.
3. **Enhances Security**: By restricting access to the internal implementation details.
4. **Encourages Reusability**: Abstract classes and interfaces can be reused across different applications.

### Implementing Abstraction in Java

1. **Using Abstract Classes**: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can contain both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).
2. **Using Interfaces**: An interface is a reference type in Java that can contain only abstract methods (until Java 8) and static/final fields. From Java 8 onwards, interfaces can also contain default and static methods.

### Practical Examples

#### Abstract Class

**Syntax**:
```java
abstract class Machine {
    abstract void operate(); // Abstract method

    void start() { // Concrete method
        System.out.println("Machine started.");
    }
}

class Tractor extends Machine {
    @Override
    void operate() {
        System.out.println("Tractor is operating.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Machine myTractor = new Tractor();
        myTractor.start();
        myTractor.operate();
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **Abstract Class (Machine)**: Contains an abstract method `operate()` and a concrete method `start()`.
- **Concrete Class (Tractor)**: Provides an implementation for the abstract method `operate()`.

#### Interface

**Syntax**:
```java
interface Operable {
    void operate(); // Abstract method

    default void start() { // Default method
        System.out.println("Machine started.");
    }
}

class Tractor implements Operable {
    @Override
    public void operate() {
        System.out.println("Tractor is operating.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Operable myTractor = new Tractor();
        myTractor.start();
        myTractor.operate();
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **Interface (Operable)**: Contains an abstract method `operate()` and a default method `start()`.
- **Concrete Class (Tractor)**: Implements the `operate()` method from the interface.

### Difference Between Abstract Class and Interface

1. **Abstract Class**:
    - Can have both abstract and concrete methods.
    - Can have instance variables.
    - Can provide constructors.
    - Supports inheritance (extends keyword).
    - Can have access modifiers like `public`, `protected`, `private`.

2. **Interface**:
    - Only abstract methods (until Java 8).
    - Can have default and static methods (from Java 8).
    - Cannot have instance variables (only static and final fields).
    - Cannot provide constructors.
    - Supports multiple inheritance (implements keyword).

3. **Concrete Class**:
    - A class that provides implementations for all its methods.
    - Can be instantiated.

### Concrete Method and Abstract Method

1. **Concrete Method**:
    - A method that has an implementation (method body).
    - Example:
      ```java
      void start() {
          System.out.println("Machine started.");
      }
      ```

2. **Abstract Method**:
    - A method that does not have an implementation (no method body).
    - Must be overridden by subclasses.
    - Example:
      ```java
      abstract void operate();
      ```

### Summary

Abstraction is a powerful concept in Java that helps in managing complexity, improving code readability, enhancing security, and promoting reusability. Abstract classes and interfaces are the primary ways to achieve abstraction in Java. Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods, while interfaces (from Java 8 onwards) can have abstract, default, and static methods.

    }
}

class Tractor extends AgriculturalMachine {
    @Override

        System.out.println("Tractor is plowing the field.");
    }
}

class Harvester extends AgriculturalMachine {
    @Override

    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **Abstract Class (Vehicle)**: Contains abstract method `performMaintenance()` and concrete methods `checkOil()` and `checkTires()`.

### Interface Examples

#### Example 1: Sensor Systems in Agricultural Machinery

**Scenario**: Different types of sensors used in agricultural machinery, each implementing specific functionalities but conforming to a common interface.

**Code**:

```java
interface Sensor {
    void readData(); // Abstract method to be implemented by classes

    default void calibrate() { // Default method
        System.out.println("Calibrating sensor.");
    }
}

class TemperatureSensor implements Sensor {

        System.out.println("Validating payment details.");
    }
}

class CreditCardProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing credit card payment of: $" + amount);
    }
}

class PayPalProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment of: $" + amount);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentProcessor creditCardProcessor = new CreditCardProcessor();
        creditCardProcessor.validatePayment();
        creditCardProcessor.processPayment(100.0);

        PaymentProcessor payPalProcessor = new PayPalProcessor();
        payPalProcessor.validatePayment();
        payPalProcessor.processPayment(200.0);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **Interface (PaymentProcessor)**: Contains an abstract method `processPayment()` and a default method `validatePayment()`.
- **Implementing Classes (CreditCardProcessor, PayPalProcessor)**: Provide specific implementations for the `processPayment()` method.

### Summary

These examples illustrate how abstract classes and interfaces can be used in practical, real-world scenarios. Abstract classes are useful when you want to share common code among several closely related classes, while interfaces are beneficial for defining a contract that multiple classes can implement, regardless of their positions in the class hierarchy.
